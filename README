NAME
    Games::Word::Wordlist::Enable - Manages the Enable word list

SYNOPSIS
     use Games::Word::Wordlist::Enable;
     my $wl = Games::Word::Wordlist::Enable -> new;
     my $word = $wl -> random_word;
     print "We have a word." if $wl -> is_word ($word);

DESCRIPTION
    "Games::Word::Wordlist::Enable" subclasses "Games::Word::Wordlist",
    giving you a managable wordlist preloaded with the words from the public
    domain *Enable* wordlist. "Games::Word::Wordlist::Enable" defines just
    one method, the class method "new", which doesn't take any arguments.

    Since "Games::Word::Wordlist" is subclassed, all its methods (except
    "new") are available.

SEE ALSO
    "Games::Word::Wordlist".
